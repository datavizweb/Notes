# Training Optimizations
* [Fast Deep Recurrent Neural Net Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-7Qk5ok4kU)
** Batch Normalization
*** Reduces internal co-variance shift
*** z-norm of the input to the neuron (non-linearity)
** Sorta graph
*** give shorter data minibatch first and longer data laters
