# Why Deep Neural Networks

* For a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate
a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function
approximation.
* Shallow networks few number of layers require more number of neurons to approximate the function (Exponentialy more)
* Deep networks require few numbers of neurons to approximate the function
