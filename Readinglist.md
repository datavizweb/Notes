> Methods to combine multiple language models had been studied and
compared in [27, 13, 28]. Most of these techniques are investigated
on n-gram LMs and their derivations, such as topic based n-gram
LM and cached based n-gram LM. RNNLMs are inherently different
from n-gram LMs in terms of their generalisation patterns. For this
reason, RNNLMs are usually linearly interpolated with n-gram LMs
to obtain both a good context coverage and strong generalisation [1,
3, 17, 18, 19, 20]. The interpolated LM probability is given by
P(wi|h
i−1
1
) = λPNG(wi|h
i−1
1
) + (1 − λ)PRN(wi|h
i−1
1
) (5)
λ is the global weight of the n-gram LM distribution PNG(·), which
can be optimized using the EM algorithm on a held-out set.
