# Pricipal Component Analysis

* Karhunen-Loveve Transform (KL Transform)

## Problem formulation

* Maximize the variance
 * Figure out the direction which has maximum variance
 * Define a unit vector u, we are interested only in direction
 * Compute the sample mean and sample variance
 * Project sample mean onto the unit vector
 * get the Covariance matrix 
 * Maximize the u^TSu
 * maximize the projected variance with constrained that u^Tu = 1
 * u^TSu + \lambda ( 1 - uTu) = 0
 
* Minimize the error

## Application

* Dimensionallity reduction
* Data dependent de-correlator


## Interview Questions

* What's the difference between MLE and MAP inference?
* What's boosting
* Compare Lasso and Ridge regression
* ROC Curves, Interpretation
* Explain what regularization is and why it is useful.
* Why it is called Genearlized Linear Model (GLM) when it is clearly not

Basics of Logistic Regression


* Given a number, how to find a closest number in a series of floating point data.
* implement the addition of two numbers, where each one of them are represented as digits of a linked list. The result should also be written in the form of digits of a linked list. 

* Five interviews. 
 * One was with the hiring manager
 * three were with other scientists
 * One was with the bar-raiser who only tested my coding skills
 * Interview Questions
  * Amazon has fourteen "leadership" principles that they like to use to evaluate candidates 
   * Frugality
   * vocally self-critical
   * They do not ask you how good you are at leadership. Instead they ask for detailed examples from your professional life in which you exemplified a specific leadership principle. 
   * Based on these responses, they decide whether or not to hire you. 
   * They usually begin with the phrase, "Tell me about a time in which you..." 
   * Unless you know about that beforehand, it can be intimidating. 
   * Some of them ask you to share negative experiences in the workplace.
